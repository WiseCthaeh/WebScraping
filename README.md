# WebScraping
Several codes for data scraping in Reddit and Coinmetrics.

# reddit_pmaw
Uses pmaw library to scrape comments and subissions from a specific subreddit.

Remember to change the subreddit, before and after timestamps for new scrapes.

Limit of posts is optional - one can add it in "submission" or "comment" (ie, in function type limit = sub_limit or limit = com_limit).

Also remember to change the destination - different for each scrape.

# Coinmetrics
